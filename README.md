# Information-System-Analysis-Design

This was one of the courses I took in Fall 2017 @ Santa Clara University. The highlights of this course were -
 1. Understanding methodology to assist in the analysis and design of computer-based information systems for business applications. 
 2. Usage of Tools: Tools include data flow diagrams, flowcharts, Structured English, pseudo code, hierarchy charts, structure diagrams. 

Application of these tools to a systems development project was required. The files added in this repository are mainly related to the project I worked on. It helped me gain expertise of building data flow diagrams using Lucidchart.

Description of the project:
‘Little Voices’ Online Management System: Implemented a portal and management system that enabled Adoption Organization to track information of several departments on a one-stop platform.
